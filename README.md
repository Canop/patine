This is a minimalist color scheme for vim, only coloring what really matters for coding.

This theme has been tuned for a `#0e0e0e` terminal color.

## Installation:

Assuming Pathogen or a similar plugin manager:

	cd ~/.vim/bundle
	git clone https://github.com/Canop/patine

Depending on your installation you might have to tell vim to run in 256 colors, which can be done by adding this to `~/.vimrc`:

	set t_Co=256

## Usage:

	:colorscheme patine
